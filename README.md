# Installing

1. Install [NodeJS](https://node.js.org/).
2. Clone the repository, and run `npm i`.

# Running
The recommended way of running jand-web is to start it with JanD.

```
cd jand-web && jand start jand-web "npm run start"
```

(In future versions) jand-web will auto detect whether it is being run under JanD and will exclude itself from the processes list.
